chibiArduino
============

chibiArduino is an open source software project based on the original Chibi wireless protocol library designed by [FreakLabs](https://www.freaklabs.org). The goal of this project is to have a simple, Arduino-compatible library that handles the wireless communications so the user can focus on creating interesting applications. Chibi means “midget” in Japanese and its appropriate for this stack because it strips wireless communications down to the fundamental operations of init, send, and receive. We've worked hard to take a minimalist approach to wireless to allow simple communications of wireless data so people can implement interesting and compelling wireless sensor applications.
