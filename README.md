chibiArduino
============

chibiArduino is an open source software project based on the original Chibi wireless protocol stack designed by [FreakLabs](https://www.freaklabs.org). This project ports the Chibi protocol stack to the Arduino platform so that people familiar with the Arduino will be able to communicate wirelessly using inexpensive IEEE 802.15.4 radios. Chibi means “midget” in Japanese and its appropriate for this stack because it strips wireless communications down to the fundamental operations of init, send, and receive. The stack relies heavily on the radio hardware to do most of the timing specific parts of the protocol which allows it to run without an operating system or a scheduler.
